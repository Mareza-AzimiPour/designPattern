/**
 * The {@code HomeTheaterFacade} class provides a simplified interface to a complex
 * home theater subsystem composed of multiple devices including
 * {@link DVDPlayer}, {@link Projector}, {@link Light}, and {@link PopcornMaker}.
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates the <strong>Facade Design Pattern</strong> by exposing
 * simple operations such as {@link #watchMovie(String)} and {@link #endMovie()}
 * that internally coordinate the behavior of all subsystem components.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Example Usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * HomeTheaterFacade homeTheater = new HomeTheaterFacade(dvd, projector, light, popcorn);
 * homeTheater.watchMovie("Inception");
 * homeTheater.endMovie();
 * </pre>
