 * The {@code ConcreateComponent} class is the core implementation of the {@link Component}

 * is closed for modification but open for extension through composition.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * Component component = new ConcreateComponent();
 * component.doJob(); // executes the base behavior
 * </pre>
