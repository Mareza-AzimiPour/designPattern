/**
 * The {@code MotorCycle} class is a concrete implementation of the
 * {@link BuilderInterface}, responsible for constructing a
 * {@link Product} that represents a motorcycle.
 * <p>
 * This class encapsulates the steps needed to assemble a motorcycleâ€™s
 * structure, including its body, wheels, and headlight configuration.
 * It forms part of the <b>Builder Design Pattern</b> implementation,
 * working alongside the {@code Director} to produce vehicle objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Pattern Role:</b> Concrete Builder</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * BuilderInterface builder = new MotorCycle();
 * Director director = new Director(builder);
 * director.construct();
 * Product motorCycle = builder.getVehicle();
 * motorCycle.showParts();
 * }</pre>
